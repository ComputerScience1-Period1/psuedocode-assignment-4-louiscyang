Players and dealers can play out their hands by hitting, standing, or splitting;
	If(hit) {
		take another card; //try to get closer to 21;

				player busts and loses;
				{

	If(stand) {
		end round; //with the cards in your current hand and hope it will beat the dealers hand;
		{
			If(dealertotal >= 17);
				Dealer must stand; //after reaching a total value of 17 in their hand;

The dealer will deal 2 cards to each player and themselves from the top of the shoe;
	Check the values of each card you have;
		If(total = 21) {
				then stand;
				}
		If(total != 21) { //but far enough from 21
				take a hit;
				}
		If(total != 21) { //and close enough to 21
				stand;
				}
		If(card1=card2) {
				then split;
				}
			Hit until your first hand value reaches a comfortable value near 21, 
				then stand;
			If(total > dealertotal) {
						you win;
						} //You can ignore your other split hand;
			If(dealertotal > total) {
						you lose;
						}
			Hit until your second hand value reaches a comfortable value near 21, then stand;
				If(firsttotal < dealertotal) {
								check secondtotal;
								}
					If(secondtotal > dealertotal) {
									you win;
									}
					If(dealertotal > secondtotal) {
									you lose;
									}
	When the dealer reveals his card;
		If(dealertotal > 21) {
					you win;
					}
		If(total > dealertotal && total <= 21) {
							win;
							}
		If(total = 21 && dealertotal = 21) {

			If(dealercards = 2 && cards = 2) {

							}
			If(dealercards = 2 && cards >= 3) {
