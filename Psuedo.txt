Blackjack

Cards 2-10 are worth their face value, face cards are each worth 10, and aces are worth either 1 or 11;
The player is to draw cards that total closer to 21 than the dealer, without going over 21, called a bust;
Each player and the dealer are given two cards.;
	Player cards are face down but they are allowed to pick them up to see.;
	The dealer must have one card facing up and the other facing down.;
Players and dealers can play out their hands by hitting, standing, or splitting;
	If you hit, you take another card to get closer to 21;
		If the total goes over 21, the player busts and loses;
			Dealers cannot hit after reaching a total value of 17 in their hand;
	If you stand, you end the round with the cards in your current hand and hope it will beat the dealers hand;
		Dealers must stand after reaching a value of 17 in their hand;
	Split can occur when you have two cards of the same valued cards;
		If you split, your pair splits into two hands;
			You play in normal fashion with your first hand until you stand or 'bust';
				Then you play your second hand until you stand or 'bust';


The dealer will deal 2 cards to each player and themselves from the shoe;
	Check the values of each card you have;
		If it is 21, then stand;
		If it is not 21 and far enough from 21, take a hit;
		If it is not 21 and close enough to 21, stand;
		If both cards are equal, then split;
			Hit until your first hand value reaches a comfortable value near 21, then stand;
				If this hands value is higher than the dealers, you win;
					You can ignore your other split hand;
				If the dealers hand value is higher than this hands, you lose;
